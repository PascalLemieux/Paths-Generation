# Paths-Generation

This project gathers some classes to generate paths to be used in Monte Carlo simulations. They are validated against the relevant theoretical moments.

The available stochastic processes are:
* Geometric Brownian Motion
* Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (Vasicek)
* Brownian Bridge
* SABR (coming soon)
